# Shortest Job First (SJF) Algorithm Implementation in Java using Stack

This repository contains an implementation of the Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm in Java utilizing the stack data structure. The SJF algorithm is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next.

## Features
- **Java Implementation**: The algorithm is implemented in Java, making it platform-independent and easily accessible.
- **Stack Data Structure**: The implementation utilizes the stack data structure to efficiently manage the sequence of processes based on their execution time.
- **Educational Resource**: This repository serves as a practical example for understanding scheduling algorithms and stack data structures in Java.
